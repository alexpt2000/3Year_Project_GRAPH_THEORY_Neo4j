# README

Design and prototype a Neo4j database for the timetabling system for a third level institute like GMIT. The database
will store information about student groups, classrooms, lecturers, and work hours â€“ just like the currently used timetabling system at GMIT.

#### [The Project - PDF](https://github.com/alexpt2000gmit/3Year_Project_GRAPH_THEORY_Neo4j/blob/master/project.pdf)



## The Model
![](https://github.com/alexpt2000gmit/3Year_Project_GRAPH_THEORY_Neo4j/blob/master/img/DesignProject.png)


### Node labels

* TimeTable
* TimerSlot
* Room
* StudentGroup
* Subject
* Lecturer

### Relationship types

* LECTURER
* SUBJECT
* ROOM
* TIMER
* GROUP

## Database Setup
Neo4j runs on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. There are desktop installers for Community Edition available for Mac OS X and Windows. There are also platform-specific packages and zip/tar archives of both Community Edition and Enterprise editions.

### Install Neo4j
[Download Neo4j Community Edition](https://neo4j.com/download/community-edition/)

### Start the Database

### Cypher Statements
You can enter the cypther commands in the Neo4j browser, or the commands are provided in the Cypher.txt file.

#### Create Node

TimeTable
```
CREATE (SoftDev3:TimeTable {course: 'BSc in Software Development', campus: 'Galway', 
year: 3, semester: 6, academicYear: '2016/2017'})
```
Timer Slot
```
CREATE (monTime13to14:TimerSlot {time: '13:00 to 14:00', weekName: 'Monday'})
```
Room
```
CREATE (room994:Room {room: 'Room 994', capacity: 90})
```
Student Group
```
CREATE (groupC:StudentGroup {group: 'Group C', totalStudents: 20})
```
Subject
```
CREATE (graphTheory:Subject {subject: 'Ghaph Theory'})
```
Lecturer
```
CREATE (ianMcloughlin:Lecturer {name: 'Ian Mcloghlin'})
```


#### Create Relationships

```
CREATE 
(monTime13to14)-[:TIME]->(SoftDev3), 
(room994)-[:ROOM]->(monTime13to14), 
(groupC)-[:GROUP]->(monTime13to14),
(graphTheory)-[:SUBJECT]->(monTime13to14), 
(ianMcloughlin)-[:LECTURER]->(graphTheory)
```
